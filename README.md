Netflix Content Analysis: A Tale of Two Eras
Dataset & Methodology
This notebook analyzes the Netflix content library by examining two distinct timeframes:

Recent Growth Trends (1991-2021): The first chart specifically analyzes the explosive growth in content added to the platform over the last three decades.
Historical Library Composition (1925-2021): The remaining analyses of genres, production countries, ratings, and top directors are based on Netflix's complete library, which includes film and television titles dating back nearly a century.
To enhance clarity, genre categories were simplified (e.g., "Children & Family Movies"), and the country analysis was filtered to show only nations with higher-than-average content production.

Key Observations & Analysis
My analysis reveals insights into both Netflix's modern strategy and the historical landscape of the media it hosts:

Accelerated Growth in the Streaming Era (1991-2021): The volume of new content, especially movies, has grown exponentially since the early 1990s. This trend highlights Netflix's aggressive content acquisition and production strategy in the modern streaming era.

A Century of US Dominance (1925-2021): Looking at the entire library, the United States has been the top producer of content for nearly 100 years. This reflects the historical dominance of Hollywood. Other key long-term contributors include India, the United Kingdom, and Canada.

Long-Standing Genre Preferences (1925-2021): The analysis of the historical library shows that Dramas and International Movies are the most common movie genres. For television, International TV Shows, Crime TV Shows, and Kids' TV have the strongest presence, indicating durable audience interest over time.

Most Prolific Directors (1925-2021): Across the entire catalog, Rajiv Chilaka is the most featured director, followed by names like Raúl Campos and Jan Suter.

Modern Ratings on Historical Content (1925-2021): The full library is predominantly categorized with modern ratings such as TV-MA (Mature Audience) and TV-14. This suggests that much of the content available, regardless of its original release year, is targeted towards adults and older teens.

Conclusion
This analysis offers a dual perspective. On one hand, Netflix's strategy since 1991 has been defined by rapid, movie-focused expansion. On the other hand, its complete library, with content stretching back to 1925, reflects a century of media history, consistently dominated by US productions and enduring genres like Drama and Crime. 
The platform's strength lies in combining this vast historical catalog with a modern, aggressive growth model to cater to a mature, global audience.
